Web Conferencing
================

Lots of problems here since popular web-conferencing software have limited support for Linux and require obnoxious add-ons. Webex needs you to install Java Plugins. Other software require Adobe Flash. Very few support HTML5 / WebRTC or other open standards on modern browsers. Here are a few noteworthy mentions of Free Software alternatives to common webconferencing systems.

- WebRTC / HTML5
- BigBlueButton - (https://bigbluebutton.org) https://mozillaignite.org/apps/374/ 
- Apache OpenMeetings - (http://openmeetings.apache.org/)
- WebHuddle - (https://www.webhuddle.com/)
- MConf - A relatively new kid on the block based on BigBlueButton (http://mconf.org/)
